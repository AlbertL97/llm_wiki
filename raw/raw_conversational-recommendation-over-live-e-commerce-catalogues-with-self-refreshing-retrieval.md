**Abstract:** Conversational recommender systems based on large language models (LLMs) are usually evaluated on static, pre-indexed item collections, yet e-commerce catalogues change continuously as products are added or removed, repriced, and restocked. We present a merchant-agnostic, multi-turn conversational shopping assistant that operates over such live catalogues. Its central component is a self-refreshing retriever that ingests a merchant product feed, enriches the records, and synchronizes them into a vector index. On each run, per-item hashes identify which products are new, changed, deleted, or unchanged, so only the delta is processed rather than rebuilding the whole catalogue. A controller-based dialogue layer consumes this index, using an LLM only for intent classification and preference elicitation while retrieval, reranking, and diversity selection run as dedicated functions. Our demonstration is a WhatsApp shopping assistant in which catalogue changes reach the recommendations after the next successful sync. A live chatbot, documentation, and a recorded walkthrough are available at https://github.com/infobip/infobip-agentic-crs.

**Key Findings/Details:**

*   **Problem:** Existing conversational recommender systems (CRS) struggle with dynamic e-commerce catalogs that change frequently.
*   **Solution:** A novel merchant-agnostic, multi-turn conversational shopping assistant designed for live catalogues.
*   **Core Component:** A "self-refreshing retriever" that efficiently processes changes (new, updated, deleted items) in product feeds and synchronizes them into a vector index.
*   **Efficiency:** Achieves efficiency by processing only the delta of changes rather than rebuilding the entire catalogue on each run.
*   **Architecture:** Features a controller-based dialogue layer that strategically uses LLMs only for intent classification and preference elicitation, delegating retrieval, reranking, and diversity selection to dedicated functions.
*   **Demonstration:** Implemented as a WhatsApp shopping assistant, showcasing recommendations that adapt to catalog changes shortly after synchronization.
*   **Availability:** Code, documentation, and a walkthrough are available on GitHub.
